• Adds real game file verification & repair (thanks to kizer)
    => Right click the login button and select "Repair game"
    => XIVLauncher will check each file and repair the broken parts
    => If you are using TexTools, this will restore the game to the original state
    => Depending on how many files need to be replaced, this can take 1-10 minutes - way faster than reinstalling the entire game
• Preparations for the march Steam update
• XIVLauncher now offers to open the official launcher when there are update server problems
• Fixes an issue wherein, on certain configurations, Visual C++ redistributables weren't detected
• Changelogs are now shown before updating, instead of after updating
• Updated localization files
