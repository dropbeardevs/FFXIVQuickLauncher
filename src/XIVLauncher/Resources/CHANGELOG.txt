• Adds an option to the Settings => Game tab that allows you to configure whether or not XIVLauncher will start the game with DPI awareness enabled
    => If the scaling of your game seems off, please try toggling this option
    => If you have auto-login enabled, you can reach the settings by holding shift when clicking the XIVLauncher shortcut

We wish all of you a lot of fun with the new expansion!
